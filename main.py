# Getting user inputs:
First_Number= int(input("Enter the first Number: "))
Second_Number= int(input("Enter the Second Number: "))

if First_Number >= Second_Number:
    if First_Number == Second_Number:
        print("First and second number are same")
    else:
        print("First Number is greater than second number")

else:
    print("Second number is greater than first Number")
